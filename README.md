# Cascadia — Digital Board Game (Kotlin)

**University Project**  
Developed by an eight-member team as part of a software engineering course.  
This project is a **digital adaptation** of the award-winning board game *Cascadia*, implemented in **Kotlin** with a focus on modularity, game logic, and user interface design.

---

## Overview

In *Cascadia*, players build interconnected habitats and populate them with wildlife native to the Pacific Northwest.  
Each round, players choose habitat tiles and wildlife tokens, placing them to create the most harmonious and diverse ecosystem.  
Scoring is based on five animal types, each with its own unique pattern requirements.  
The player with the highest score at the end wins.

## Project Background

The project was created by a group of university students inspired by the beauty and balance of nature.  
Our goal was to develop a relaxing yet strategic **digital board game** that captures the spirit of the original *Cascadia* while adding interactive and multiplayer features.  

The project served as an exercise in software architecture, collaborative development, and clean coding practices.
